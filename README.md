linkifyjs
=========

This is a small script to linkify urls, email addresses, and twitter handles in a string, extracted from the twitter widget at <http://wmnf.org>.

The code is mostly from <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37684/how-to-replace-plain-urls-with-links/7123542#7123542>. There are other, more extensive solutions out there, notably <https://github.com/cowboy/javascript-linkify>.

Example:

    text.linkify()
